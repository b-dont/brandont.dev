This is the public repo for my personal website, currently undergoing an entire redesign. The website will be structured with minimal, light-weight deployment and design principles, getting inspiration from [blot.im](https://blot.im), where I currently run [my blog](https://brandont.blog). 

The site will be developed using the [Zola](https://getzola.org/) static site engine, and the [readable.css](https://readable-css.freedomtowrite.org/) framework. 

Deployment is planned to be handled in [Podman](https://podman.io/); additionally, I'd like to mimic blot's "blog-in-a-folder" principle, and deploy blog posts to the site using git repositories.
