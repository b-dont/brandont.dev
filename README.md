This is the public repo for my personal website [btp.dev](https://btp.dev). This is where I host my blog, post my favorite personal projects, and list my other goings-on around the internet.

### Development
To run the development container, you'll need to install [`podman`](https://github.com/containers/podman) or [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). You can also run the static site from the `zola` development server with the following command from the `src` directory.
```
zola --config zola.toml serve
```
