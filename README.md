# Portfolio Site [brandont.dev](https://brandont.dev)

This is the public repo for my portfolio website, currently undergoing an entire redesign. The website will be structured with minimal, light-weight deployment and design principles, getting inspiration from [blot.im](https://blot.im), where I currently run [my blog](https://brandont.blog). 

The site will be developed using the [Zola](https://getzola.org/) static site engine, and the [readable.css](https://readable-css.freedomtowrite.org/) framework. 

## TODO
1. Finish `Home` page
- `About Me` section
- Most recent Blog Post
- Current project
2. Create `Projects` page
- Contains projects in chronological order.
- Brief synopsis of the project, tags for languages.
- Links to public repos and examples
3. `Contact` page
- Fillable email form with ReCaptcha and other contact links (socials)
