This is the public repo for my personal website [brandont.dev](https://brandont.dev). This is where I host my blog, post my favorite personal projects, and list my other goings-on around the internet.

If you'd like to fork this site and develop from that, then just fork the repo, install [Zola](https://getzola.org/) and run `zola serve` from the root directory. Then, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:1111/` to see the static site. See the [Zola docs](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/) for more info.
