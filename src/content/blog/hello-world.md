It's my first post on the new website! After a couple of months of work, I've finished the new website. So far, I'm pretty happy with how it's turned out, and the ideas I have for future additions to the site.

I'll be treating this website as my "central hub on the internet; a master repository of my projects, experience, thoughts, and communications. I'm pretty excited to write more on my little corner of the internet, and expand outwards from it.
